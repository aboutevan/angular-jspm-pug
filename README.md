# Angular, Gulp and JSPM
___

This is an opionated starter for getting (static) sites up and running quickly with AngularJS (1.5.x) and JSPM.  It utilizes a bunch of gulp tasks for the build, and expects Sass to be written with BEM philosophy and ES2015 written in accordnance with ESLint rules, specifically the XO rule set.
